Asuming you have python installed, open cmd (Command Prompt). Use cd to get to the project folder. 
Then type:
python -m venv .venv

When you do this, you should see a new folder .venv created in your current folder. Now type:

.venv\Scripts\activate
This runs the activate script in our virtual environment folder, which means our terminal is n	ow pointing at a new version of python that is located at .venv\Scripts\python.exe


Now run:
python get-pip.py
Then
pip install numpy
pip install pyzbar
pip install opencv-python
